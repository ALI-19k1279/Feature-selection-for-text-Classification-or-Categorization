half million people annually kill n cancer cancer type disease cell grow control divide invade tissue person without cancer cell division control tissue healthy cell divide controlled way copy create new healthy cell cancer normal cell division go control cell change nature mutation occurred gene daughter cell cancer cell also cancerousn abnormal cell invade divide swell original tissue called cancer called tumour tumour usually threat life cut however tumour occur place cut fatal brain tumour typen symptom cancer caused cancerous cell invading tissue called metastasis metastasis cancer cell move bloodstream lymphatic system happens person cancer spread throughout body eventually tissue work well whole body begin get worse may dien cancer affect anybody age type cancer likely affect people get older person dna get older dna may become damaged damage happened past may get worse one type cancer common young men rather older people testicular cancer cancer testicle n cancer one biggest researched cause death developed country studying cancer treatment called oncologyn cancer one common cause death around world cause one every eight death worldwide according world health organizationn different type cancer different cause thing known cause cancer specific body part thing known able cause many different type cancer example using tobacco smoked smokeless cause many type cancer lung mouth tongue throat cancer thing known able cause cancer make person likely get cancer include radiation including sunlight xray large many dos exposure radiation example nuclear power plant chemical material used building manufacturing example asbestos benzene highfat lowfiber diet air water pollution eating little fruit vegetable obesity enough physical activity drinking much alcohol certain chemical commonly used home cancer also caused virus many people exposed thing get cancer notn many different kind cancer common n sure cure cancer cured cancerous cell cut killed place mean earlier cancer treated better chance cure cancer cell may enough time copy spread much person cured n different type treatment may kill cancer cell treatment n reason treating cancer complicated example n many many people many country study cancer work finding treatment ha good progress finding treatment many cancer treated success along looking different medical treatment treat cancer study also look thing people cancer try make healthier example one study showed person lymphedema swelling arm linked breast cancer lift weight may able fight cancer better somebody doe lift weightsn cancer ha around many thousand year today lot medical term used describe cancer come ancient greek latin example latinized greek word carcinoma used describe malignant tumor tumor made cancer cell greek also used word karkinos would translated aulus cornelius celsus latin word cancer prefix carcino still used medical word like carcinoma carcinogenic famous greek doctor galen helped create another word important medicine today using word onkos describe tumour word oncology branch medicine deal cancer come n hippocrates famous ancient doctor often called father modern medicine named many kind cancer called benign tumour tumor made cancer cell oncos greek onkos mean swelling called malignant tumour karkinos mean crab crayfish greek used term thought solid malignant tumor wa cut vein looked like crab vein stretched side animal crab ha foot whence derives get name hippocrates later added oma greek swelling word carcinos word carcinoma came aboutn ancient greek believe opening dead body study hippocrates wa able describe make drawing tumor saw outside body drew tumor skin nose breastsn hippocrates doctor time treated people based humor theory theory said four type fluid body black yellow bile blood phlegm doctor tried figure whether four humor body fluid balance would use treatment like bloodletting cutting patient letting bleed would lose blood laxative giving patient food herb make go bathroom andor changing patient diet doctor thought treatment would work get patient four humor back right balance humor theory treatment wa popular th century cell discovered time people realized cancer happen anywhere bodyn oldest known document talk cancer wa discovered egypt thought bc document talk using surgery treat eight case ulcer breast treated cauterization burning using tool called fire drill document also say cancer treatment n another early type surgery used treat cancer wa written canon medicine avicenna ibn sina said treatment involve cutting diseased tissue included use amputation removing part body completely removing vein ran direction tumor avicenna also suggested area treated cauterized burned needed n th th century doctor started allowed dissect body cut open death order figure cause death around time many different idea caused cancer german professor wilhelm fabry believed breast cancer wa caused clot milk part woman breast produce milk dutch professor francois de la boe sylvius believed disease wa caused chemical process thought cancer particular wa caused acidic lymph nicolaes tulp lived time sylvius believed cancer wa poison slowly spread wa contagious n british surgeon named percivall pott wa first person figure one real cause cancer discovered cancer scrotum wa common disease among chimney sweep people cleaned chimney doctor started studying topic coming idea cause cancer doctor started working together coming better ideasn th century many people started use microscope made big difference helping doctor scientist understand cancer using microscope scientist able see cancer poison spread one tumor lymph node site metastasis wa first made clear english surgeon campbell de morgan n th century using surgery treat cancer usually bad result doctor understand important hygiene keeping thing clean preventing disease especially surgery thing kept clean surgery patient often got infection died example one wellknown scottish surgeon alexander monro kept record found patient every surgery breast tumor died within next two yearsn th century surgical hygiene got better asepsis doctor realized dirtiness germ cause infection started keep thing cleaner thing kill germ order prevent patient getting infection became common people survive surgery surgical removal tumor taking tumor body surgery became firstchoice treatment cancer kind treatment work surgeon operation good removing tumor meant even people kind cancer could get different result getting good treatment worked others getting treatment work difference good different surgeon n late doctor scientist started realize body made many kind tissue turn made million cell discovery started age cellular pathology studying cell learn disease figure wrong body n french scientist discovered radioactive decay radiation therapy became first cancer treatment worked involve surgery required new multidisciplinary approach cancer treatment people different job working together treat patient surgeon wa longer working worked together hospital radiologist people gave read xray help patient team approach meant change worked different people team communicate work together used also meant treatment done hospital rather patient home patients information put together file kept hospital called medical record information wa kept written scientist able first statistical patient study using number study question like many people certain type cancer get certain treatment surviven another important step forward understanding cancer happened janet laneclaypon published paper cancer epidemiology epidemiology field study look common disease pattern disease take different kind people mean understanding treating disease historic paper wa comparative study try find cause disease looking group people disease figuring different another group doe disease laneclayton study looked people background lifestyle way living people breast cancer control patient people without breast cancer people many way got breast cancer figure might causing certain people get breast cancer study looked wa different people compared looked alongside people get cancern laneclayton study wa published british ministry health work cancer epidemiology wa continued richard doll austin bradford hill used way studying cancer laneclayton looked different kind cancer lung cancer published result paper called lung cancer cause death relation smoking second report mortality british doctor also called british doctor study later richard doll left london medical research center mrc started oxford unit cancer epidemiology using computer unit wa able something new important brought together large amount cancer data piece information cancer way studying cancer important cancer epidemiology today ha also important shaping know cancer rule law disease public health today past xayears many different people done lot work collect data different doctor hospital area state even country data used study whether different kind cancer le common different area environment example big city compared countryside culture help people study cancer figure make people le likely get different kind cancern world war ii doctor hospital getting better collecting getting keeping data patient cancer wa rare data shared doctor hospital changed wwii medical research center found different country different number case cancer many country created national public health organization studied public health issue entire country national public health organization began bring together health data many different doctor hospital helped figure reason cancer wa much common certain place example japan people studying cancer found people survived atomic bombing hiroshima nagasaki bone marrow wa completely destroyed helped realize diseased bone marrow could also destroyed radiation wa important step figuring leukemia blood cancer treated bone marrow transplantsn since world war ii scientist kept finding better cancer treatment however thing still need get better example good treatment many kind cancer still treatment certain kind cancer cancer progress get worse certain stage disease also cancer treatment exist standardized one agreedupon way giving every treatment used time treatment given cancer treatment also available everywhere world people need keep studying cancer epidemiology forming international partnership different country work together find cure make cancer treatment available everywheren candidiasis candidiasis often called yeast
